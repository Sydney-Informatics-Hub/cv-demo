## Introduction 

Self driving cars. Face recognition. These are just the tip of the iceberg of applications for a technology called computer vision. 

We've had cameras and computers for a long time, but now we have the technology to make our computers understand the pictures and videos captured by our cameras. 
Researchers around the world are competing to develop better and better computer vision algorithms that can understand and make predictions about pictures. One of the most famous models is called YOLO: You Only Look Once. 
YOLO models have state of the art prediction speed, allowing computers to make extremely fast descisions about images they are seeing.
In this workshop, SIH Data Scientist Dr Henry Lydecker will show you how you can take a YOLO model that have been trained to solve a problem on one dataset, and then fine tune the model to solve a similar problem but with a totally new dataset.
You'll learn the basic concepts behind computer vision and transfer learning, and will be shown how to use industry leading open source tools in Python, including Pytorch and torchvision, and how to use them on cloud computing virtual environments so that you can get access to powerful CUDA enabled GPUs to accelerate machine learning.
